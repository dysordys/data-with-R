1.3.3

4.2

4.2.6
* Maybe this chapter would be good for a paragraph or two on 1) how to organize code/data; 2) how to name files/variables
5.1.5
* Mention transmute?
6.2
* I now always use summarise(..., .groups = "drop") instead of summarise() %>% ungroup() because sometimes it does not remove all groupings?
