1.2 What about Linux? :-)
1.3.3
- Maybe mention R Projects?

4.2
- Many had trouble downloading the files, because they open as some form of HTML
4.2.6
- Maybe this chapter would be good for a paragraph or two on 1) how to organize code/data; 2) how to name files/variables

5.1.5
- Mention transmute?

6.2
- I now always use summarise(..., .groups = "drop") instead of summarise() %>% ungroup() because sometimes it does not remove all groupings?

Ch 9 (Introducing statistical inference)
- Maybe have a link to the code generating the data

Ch10
- Some people were confused about the first diagnostic plot; in the QQ plot, the curve seems to deviate considerably from 1:1 for high quantiles
- Footnote on QQ plot: the residuals are also standardized; thus it should always be the 1:1 line
- the difference between the two TREATMENT groups stands a reasonable

Ch 12
- In the Anscombe data, also R^2 is the same for all data sets. Speaking of which, maybe it's worth introducing R^2 as it is often reported
